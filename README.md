# Events Lab
I hated this lab, but ended up being thankful for what i was learning while doing it. The entire premise of this lab was painful, we were givin a website in which the html was written entirly in vanilla js and then asked to add the functionality to the webpage via event listeners. The lab itself came with some bugs that had to be fixed before I could begin (secretly part of the lab challange? I dont know). But once I fixed the bugs the rest of this came easily. I was already fairly familiar from event listeners as I had begun this lab after working on my breakout game, but during this i began to believe i actually understood what i was doing vs just regurgitating what I had read online I should be doing. I hope this is the last time I have to work with HTML written in js.
